## 🛠 Setup & Deployment

1. Clone this repo and configure your Medusa backend in /backend.
2. Set AWS credentials in GitHub repo Secrets.
3. Push to the main branch to trigger deployment.
4. Terraform will:
   - Create VPC, Subnets, Security Groups
   - Deploy RDS Postgres instance
   - Build & push Docker image to ECR
   - Launch ECS Fargate task and ALB

---

## 🌐 Access

Once deployment completes, Terraform outputs the Load Balancer DNS:

```bash
Outputs:
load_balancer_dns_name = http://<ALB-DNS>
```

Open the URL in your browser to access Medusa backend API.
